### 📖 My Dream & Aspiration

💡 *"My ultimate goal is to become a Hafiz, memorizing the entire Quran."* 💡  

I believe that balancing technology and spirituality is the key to a meaningful life. While I immerse myself in software development, I also dedicate my time to achieving this noble goal.

Memorizing the Quran is one thing, but preserving it in the heart and living by it is a far greater challenge—just like writing code is easy, but maintaining its quality and functionality over time is the real test. 🚀
